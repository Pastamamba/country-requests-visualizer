# Country Requests Visualizer

A dynamic React application that visualizes country-specific request data on a world map using D3 and [react-simple-maps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-maps). This project displays request volume by country using an interactive map, offering an intuitive way to explore and compare global request statistics.

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification to maintain clear and structured commit messages. This helps both humans and automated tools understand the changes in the project.

#### **Commit Message Structure**

A commit message follows this format:

```plaintext
<type>(optional scope): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer (e.g., BREAKING CHANGE)]
```

#### **Common Commit Types**

| Type       | Description                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | Introduce a new feature to the codebase     |
| `fix`      | Fix a bug in the codebase                   |
| `docs`     | Create/update documentation                 |
| `style`    | Feature and updates related to styling      |
| `refactor` | Refactor a specific section of the codebase |
| `test`     | Add or update code related to testing       |
| `chore`    | Regular code maintenance                    |

#### **Example Commit Messages**

- **Adding a new feature:**

  ```plaintext
  feat(api): add support to create coupons
  ```

- **Fixing a bug:**

  ```plaintext
  fix(auth): resolve login token expiration issue
  ```

- **Updating documentation:**

  ```plaintext
  docs: update API reference for authentication
  ```

- **Breaking changes:**  
  To indicate a breaking change, you can use **BREAKING CHANGE:** in the footer or add **!** after the commit type:

  ```plaintext
  chore!: update Python version to use newer libs

  More recent versions of important project libraries no longer support Python 3.6.
  This has prevented us from using new features offered by such libraries.
  Add support for Python 3.12.

  BREAKING CHANGE: drop support for Python 3.6.
  ```

By following this convention, we ensure a structured and maintainable commit history.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
2. **Pull the latest changes from upstream**
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   ```
3. **Delete the branch locally**
