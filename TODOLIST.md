# Project Milestones and To-Do List

This document outlines the key milestones for the project along with actionable tasks. Each milestone represents a significant phase in the development and enhancement of the interactive map and data visualization features.

---

## Milestone 1: Project Setup & Initial Architecture
- [ ✔️ ] **Project Initialization**
    - Setup the project structure using your preferred React/TypeScript boilerplate (e.g., Create React App, Vite, etc.).
    - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript settings.
- [ ✔️ ] **Folder Organization**
    - Create folders for components, types, styles, assets, and utilities.
    - Define a basic naming convention and coding standards.

---

## Milestone 2: Interactive Map Implementation
- [ ✔️ ] **Integrate Map Libraries**
    - Integrate `react-simple-maps` and configure the base map (Sphere, Graticule, etc.).
- [ ✔️ ] **Zoom and Pan Functionality**
    - Implement the `ZoomableGroup` to enable zooming and panning.
- [ ✔️ ] **Basic Tooltip**
    - Show a tooltip on hover with basic country information.

---

## Milestone 3: Country-Based Request Data Visualization
- [ ] **Data Fetching**
    - Fetch country request data from the API endpoint (e.g., `/country_requests_data.json`).
    - Parse and store data using a well-defined TypeScript interface.
- [ ] **Color Scale Mapping**
    - Use `d3-scale` to map request counts to a color gradient.
    - Apply the color scale to fill countries based on their request numbers.
- [ ] **Tooltip Enhancement**
    - Display request count data in the tooltip on hover.

---

## Milestone 4: City-Level Request Tracking
- [ ] **Extend Data Model**
    - Update the data model to include city-level request data (if available).
- [ ] **Drill-Down Feature**
    - Implement interactive elements (e.g., markers, popups) to show city-level details.
- [ ] **Visualization Adjustments**
    - Enable users to see a breakdown of requests per city within a country.

---

## Milestone 5: Country Selection & Filtering Features
- [ ] **Search and Highlight**
    - Enhance the search input to filter countries and highlight matches on the map.
- [ ] **Multi-Selection Functionality**
    - Allow users to select one or more countries to track.
- [ ] **Settings Panel**
    - Build a settings or filter panel for choosing which countries (and potentially cities) to monitor.

---

## Milestone 6: Performance Optimization & Code Refactoring
- [ ] **TypeScript Enhancements**
    - Replace all explicit `any` types with specific interfaces (e.g., `MapPosition`, `GeographyFeature`).
- [ ] **Component Decomposition**
    - Split the map and tooltip code into smaller, reusable components.
- [ ] **Performance Checks**
    - Optimize rendering performance, especially for map interactions and tooltips.

---

## Milestone 7: UI/UX Improvements & Styling
- [ ] **Component Styling**
    - Refine the CSS for the map, search input, and tooltip (using CSS modules, styled-components, or similar).
- [ ] **Responsive Design**
    - Ensure the map and UI components are fully responsive across devices.
- [ ] **Accessibility Enhancements**
    - Improve accessibility for interactive elements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, etc.).

---

## Milestone 8: Documentation & Testing
- [ ] **Documentation**
    - Write comprehensive README and inline documentation.
    - Document API endpoints, data models, and component usage.
- [ ] **Unit & Integration Tests**
    - Write unit tests for individual components.
    - Implement integration tests for map interactions and data filtering.
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests**
    - Setup E2E tests for core user flows (search, zoom, tooltip interactions).

---

## Milestone 9: Data Caching & Error Handling
- [ ] **Implement Data Caching**
    - Cache API responses to reduce load times and improve performance.
- [ ] **Robust Error Handling**
    - Gracefully handle API errors and display user-friendly messages.
- [ ] **Monitoring**
    - Integrate logging or monitoring tools to track errors and performance issues.

---

## Milestone 10: Deployment & Post-Launch Monitoring
- [ ] **Production Build**
    - Optimize and build the project for production.
- [ ] **Deployment Pipeline**
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., with Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Actions).
- [ ] **Post-Launch Metrics & Feedback**
    - Plan for analytics integration and user feedback collection.
    - Monitor performance and usage post-launch for further improvements.

---

**Additional Ideas:**

- **Country-Specific Request Details:**  
  Implement a feature that displays request details by country and further breaks it down by city.
- **Customizable Tracking:**  
  Allow users to choose which countries and cities they want to monitor, possibly saving their preferences.
- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard:**  
  Create a dashboard view to visualize trends and compare request statistics across regions over time.
